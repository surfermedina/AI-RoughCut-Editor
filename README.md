# AI Rough Cut Editor

This project uses Adobe Premiere's auto-generated transcripts and ChatGPT to create timecoded scripts for quick video rough cuts. 

An explanation of how the basic technique works is here: https://www.moreyummy.com/ai-video-editing
Also on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/1S2o2clDvRU

## What it does
- Transforms transcripts into themed scripts using LLMs
- Outputs timecodes for fast rough cut assembly
- Future goal: Auto-generate XML or OTIO files for direct import into Premiere

## Why it matters
This approach brings theme-driven storytelling and massive time savings to professional video editing.

## Get Involved
The goal of this project is to integrate these tools into a professional editing NLE such as Adobe Premiere.
