# AI Rough Cut Editor

This project uses Adobe Premiere's auto-generated transcripts and ChatGPT to create timecoded scripts for quick video rough cuts. 

An explanation of how the basic technique works is here: [https://www.moreyummy.com/ai-video-editing]

# üìÇ Examples

This folder contains working examples to demonstrate how the AI Rough Cut Editor workflow operates using Adobe Premiere transcripts and ChatGPT prompts.

## üìù Files

### [`JFK - Moon Speech-transcript.txt`](https://github.com/surfermedina/AI-RoughCut-Editor/blob/main/examples/JFK%20-%20Moon%20Speech-transcript.txt)
This is a sample transcript exported from Adobe Premiere Pro using the **Text-Based Editing** workspace. It includes speaker labels and timecodes, formatted exactly as Premiere outputs them.

### [`JFK - Moon Speech-prompt.txt`](https://github.com/surfermedina/AI-RoughCut-Editor/blob/main/examples/JFK%20-%20Moon%20Speech-prompt.txt)
This file contains a structured prompt designed to guide ChatGPT (or another LLM) in transforming the transcript into a themed, timecoded script. The prompt is focused on extracting moments from Churchill‚Äôs speech that reflect the theme of **resilience**‚Äîeven though the word itself is never spoken.

## üí° How to Use These Files

1. Open [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) or another LLM interface.
2. Copy the contents of the prompt into the chat.
3. Upload the full contents of the transcript when prompted.
4. Let the model generate a new rough cut script based on the theme.
5. Use the resulting timecodes to quickly assemble a timeline in Premiere Pro.

## üß† Why It Matters

This demo shows how an LLM can understand **themes and narrative context**, going beyond literal keyword searches. It's a powerful example of how AI can save editors hours of manual work.
