'Churchill - AI Demo' - A recording of Churchill's 'Never Surrender' speech


00:00:00:00 - 00:00:50:23
Winston Churchill
When? A week ago today. Mr. speaker, I asked the House to fix this afternoon as the occasion for a statement, I said it would be my hard luck to announce the greatest military disaster in our long history. I thought, and some good judges agreed with me. Advance 20 or 30,000 men might be remembered, as it suddenly seemed the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the British Expeditionary Force north of the Emir had the jab, would be broken up in the open field or held for them.

00:00:50:25 - 00:01:29:05
Winston Churchill
Dig a bit today for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy charging which I called upon the house and the nation to prepare themselves a week ago. The whole root and call and brain as a military government, armed with and around which we were to build and are to build a great British army in the later years of the war, and about to perish in the field of danger and ignominious and starving captive again.

00:01:29:07 - 00:01:59:05
Winston Churchill
The enemy attacked us on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and our main power, the power of that far more numerical force, was thrown into the battle area of concentrated upon Dunkirk and the beaches pressing in upon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west. The enemy began to fire with cannons upon the beaches.

00:01:59:07 - 00:02:34:03
Winston Churchill
By later the shipping could approach only path. They showed magnetic mines in the channels and fields. They sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft, sometimes more than 100 strong, in one formation. They crossed bombs and the single pair that remained, and upon the sand dunes on which the troops had their only shelter. The U-boats, one of which was sank and their motor launches took the toll of the vast traffic.

00:02:34:05 - 00:03:30:06
Winston Churchill
We shall begin for 4 or 5 days, and intense drag will raid all their armor divisions. A lot were left of them together was a great message of infantry and artillery, held and held in vain upon the ever narrowing and the contracting appendix within which the British and French armies fought. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy was a willing help of countries merchant seamen strained every nerve to embark the British and Allied troops, 220 Allied warships and 650 other vessels where gauged, dared to operate under difficulties and often in adverse weather, and an almost distant hail of bombs and an increasing concentration of artillery.

00:03:30:08 - 00:04:01:19
Winston Churchill
No. Over the seas, as I have said themselves, these are lines and are bigger, enduring conditions such as these. The diamond carry on with little or no rest for days and nights on end. May trip up to trip across the dangerous waters, bringing with them always men who may adventure the number they have brought back as a measure of their devotion and their courage.

00:04:01:22 - 00:04:42:28
Winston Churchill
The little ships which broke off many thousands of British and 2000 being plainly marked a very special target for Nazi bombers. But the men and women on board them never faltered in their duty. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already been intervening in the battle divided rain, could allow air from a home base in now huge part of its main metropolitan fighting strength and struck at the German bombers and the fighters, which in large numbers protected.

00:04:43:01 - 00:05:29:20
Winston Churchill
Its struggle with protracted and fierce. Suddenly citizens gathered the crash and thunder, and for the moment, but only for them having died away. A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by fervid discipline, by faultless service I. Reinforced by skill, by unconquerable fidelity. It manifests to a general the enemy thinks, held back by the retreating British troops, who were so rough handling that he did not carry the departure area.

00:05:29:22 - 00:06:00:23
Winston Churchill
Sir, we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attribute of a victory was not won by evacuation, but there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted. It will gain by the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force for good. They one of the bombers, the skeptics protective attack.

00:06:00:26 - 00:06:29:10
Winston Churchill
The underrated achievement. I have heard much talk of this, and that is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it. This was a great trial of strength between the British and German air forces. Can you conceive a greater objective of the Germans in the air than to make evacuation from these beaches impossible?

00:06:29:12 - 00:07:02:20
Winston Churchill
And just think, all these ships, which were displayed almost to the extent of starvation, could have been an objective and greater military importance and significance for those visitors? Or was it? They tried hard and they were beaten back. They were frustrated in their task. We got the army away and they have paid for both and any losses which they have in reaching.

00:07:02:22 - 00:07:37:10
Winston Churchill
Sir, when we consider how much greater would be ours in defending the air above, they died in the air in an overseas attack. And I say this I find in the effects of sugar baking a bulwark practical and reassuring, its own risk. I will pay my tribute to these young airmen, the great French army. They largely, for the time being, tossed back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of armored vehicles.

00:07:37:12 - 00:08:11:15
Winston Churchill
May it not also be that the college of civilization itself will be defended by the skill and devotion of a few thousand German? There never had been. I suppose in all the world, in all the history of war, that's an opportunity to use the Knights of the Round Table, the Crusaders, or fall back into the past, not only distant, but per day.

00:08:11:17 - 00:08:50:22
Winston Churchill
These young men, going forth every morning, regard their native land and all that which stands for holding in their hands these instruments and colossal, colossally shattering power. Of whom it may be said that every morn brought forth a nobler chance, and every chance brought forth an night in our gratitude. And to all the brave men, in so many ways, and on so many occasions, I ready and continue ready to give life in all their native land.

00:08:50:24 - 00:09:23:27
Winston Churchill
Nevertheless, thankfulness at the escape of our army and so many men whose loved ones have passed through an agonizing week, but not blind us to the fact that what happened in France and Belgium is a colossal military disaster. The French army has been weakened. The Belgian army has been lost. A large part of those fortified lines of human faith had been reposed, had gone.

00:09:24:08 - 00:09:52:05
Winston Churchill
Many valuable mining districts and factories have passed into the enemy's predictions. The whole of the channel ports, i.e. hands, and all the tragic consequences that follow from that. And we must expect another blow to be struck almost immediately at us, or from. We are told, sir, that Hitler has a plan for invading the British Isles.

00:09:52:05 - 00:09:58:17
Winston Churchill
The development being sort of mythos by Napoleon led bullion for a year.

00:09:58:19 - 00:10:15:12
Winston Churchill
The fat bottomed boats and a grand army. He would tell by someone that a bitter week in England. Yeah, Sydney. A great many more of them. Since the British Expeditionary Force returned.

00:10:15:12 - 00:10:38:20
Winston Churchill
So I have myself full confidence that you will do that if nothing is exacted, and if the best of reasons are made and they are being made, we should prove ourselves once more able to defend our island home, to ride out the storm of war and to have lives a menace of tyranny if

00:10:38:20 - 00:10:39:07
Winston Churchill
necessary.

00:10:39:07 - 00:11:08:19
Winston Churchill
There's, if necessary, alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of individuals in government, every man, and that is the will of Parliament in the nation, the British Empire and the French Republic link together in their code and in our need will descend to the death soil, edging each other like good comrades to the atmosphere.

00:11:08:19 - 00:11:09:20
Winston Churchill
That strength.

00:11:09:20 - 00:11:26:19
Winston Churchill
We shall go on to the end. We will fight in France a good fight on the seas and oceans we should fight. The growing confidence and growing strength in the air. Special. Defend our island, whatever that

00:11:26:19 - 00:11:36:19
Winston Churchill
cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches. They should fight on the landing grounds. We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.

00:11:36:22 - 00:12:10:17
Winston Churchill
We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender. And if I do not for a moment believe this island, or a large part of it, when subjugated and starving, and our empire, beyond these unarmed and God invisible defeat, we carry on the struggle until in God's good time, the new world, with all its power, might step off to the rescue and the liberation of the old.
